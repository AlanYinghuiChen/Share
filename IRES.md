#### cellular IRESs
The cellular IRESs can be roughly classified into two types based on the mechanisms of ribosome recruitment: 
- type I IRESs  
   interact with ribosomes through ITAFs(IRES-transacting factors) that bound on the ciselements, e.g. RNA binding motifs and N-6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification.  
- type II IRESs   
   contain a short cis-element that pairs with 18S rRNA to recruit ribosomes (similar to Shine-Dalgarno sequences in bacteria) 

#### IRES trans-acting factors
- crosstalk between translation and RNA transcription/processing
Most ITAFs were identified as nuclear proteins or proteins shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm, implying a crosstalk between translation and RNA transcription/processing.

- polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB)  
promote the activity for both viral and cellular IRESs. Interestingly, this protein is also involved in the regulation of mRNA splicing, stability, and transport (Sawicka et al., 2008).
