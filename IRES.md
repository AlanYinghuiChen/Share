#### cellular IRESs
The cellular IRESs can be roughly classified into two types based on the mechanisms of ribosome recruitment: 
- type I IRESs  
   interact with ribosomes through ITAFs(IRES-transacting factors) that bound on the ciselements, e.g. RNA binding motifs and N-6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification.  
- type II IRESs   
   contain a short cis-element that pairs with 18S rRNA to recruit ribosomes (similar to Shine-Dalgarno sequences in bacteria)
