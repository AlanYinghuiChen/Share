#### IRES in cellular stress response
Previous studies have shown that 10% of the mRNA may contain the IRESs (Spriggs et al., 2008; Weingarten-Gabbay et al.,
2016)

The requirement of IRESs is easy to fulfill, and thus many sequences can drive cap-independent translation.

Cap-dependent translation becomes impaired under stress conditions (Spriggs et al., 2010; Ryoo and Vasudevan, 2017),
therefore it is tempting to speculate that many of the novel ORFs might encode peptides with functions in cellular stress response
pathways. 

#### alternative translation
Similar to alternative splicing, this ‘alternative translation’ may serve as a new mechanism to increase the proteome complexity
encoded by the human genome

#### cellular IRESs
The cellular IRESs can be roughly classified into two types based on the mechanisms of ribosome recruitment: 
- type I IRESs  
   interact with ribosomes through ITAFs(IRES-transacting factors) that bound on the ciselements, e.g. RNA binding motifs and N-6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification.  
- type II IRESs   
   contain a short cis-element that pairs with 18S rRNA to recruit ribosomes (similar to Shine-Dalgarno sequences in bacteria) 

#### IRES trans-acting factors
- crosstalk between translation and RNA transcription/processing
Most ITAFs were identified as nuclear proteins or proteins shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm, implying a crosstalk between translation and RNA transcription/processing.

- polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB)  
promote the activity for both viral and cellular IRESs. Interestingly, this protein is also involved in the regulation of mRNA splicing, stability, and transport (Sawicka et al., 2008).

#### circRNA in cellular IRES in vivo detection
Since the circRNA can only be translated through cap-independent fashion, this system will be able to avoid the false discovery of IRESs that occurred in linear RNAs.

circRNA reporter system will be a useful tool to examine the activity of cellular IRESs.

### m6A and IRES
Interestingly, using circRNA reporter genes, it was reported that many short RNA elements containing m6A have IRES-like activity to drive the cap-independent translation of circRNAs (Yang et al., 2017).
